# Chat with PDF using Gemini-1.5-Pro 🌟

This application allows you to interact with a PDF document by asking questions and receiving concise, context-aware answers. Built with **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **Google Generative AI** models, it leverages advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to deliver an efficient Q&A experience.

---

## Features

- 📄 **Document Parsing**: Load and preprocess PDF files for NLP tasks.  
- 🔍 **Efficient Retrieval**: Uses FAISS for vector-based document retrieval with embeddings.  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Chat**: Integrated with **Gemini-1.5-Pro** for intelligent and context-aware responses.  
- 🧩 **Customizable Components**: Modular design allows for flexible text chunking, retrieval, and LLM configuration.  
- 💻 **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and interactive front-end for seamless user experience.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or later
- Pip for package management

Install all required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-with-pdf.git
   cd chat-with-pdf
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following keys:
     ```
     GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works

### 1. **PDF Loading**
The `get_doc()` function uses `PyPDFLoader` to parse the document and load its content into memory.

### 2. **Chunking Text**
The `chunkking(data)` function splits the document into manageable pieces using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

### 3. **Embedding Creation**
The `embeddings(chunks)` function uses **GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings** to generate embeddings for each chunk and store them in a FAISS vector database.

### 4. **Retrieval**
The `Retriever(vector_DB)` function retrieves the most relevant document chunks based on user queries.

### 5. **Language Model**
The `LLM()` function initializes **ChatGoogleGenerativeAI** using the `Gemini-1.5-Pro` model for intelligent responses.

### 6. **RAG Chain**
The `create_rag_chain()` function combines retrieval and language model capabilities into a cohesive RAG pipeline.
